# CasRel-on-a-Chinese-dataset
We transferred the SOTA Relation Extraction technique CasRel to a Chinese dataset provided by Baidu.
We improved the original CasRel by combining the algorithm with Chinese word segmentation tool TPL and whole word masking mechanism.

Most of the codes are from our last project -- re-implement of the CasRel. And you can find its adoption on the Chinese dataset in the 'CasRel-Chinese.ipynb' file.
